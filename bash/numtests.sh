# this script demonstrates doing numeric tests in bash

# TASK 1: Improve it by getting the user to give us the numbers to use in our tests
# TASK 2: Improve it by adding a test to tell the user if the numbers are even or odd
# TASK 3: Improve it by adding a test to tell the user is the second number is a multiple of the first number
